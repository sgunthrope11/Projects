<h2>Current Project's</h2>
<p>For my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/18nWsv0Li1bFYWS547ERRkE6FQU-fbPfb"> Project's </a> currently i only have two which where for my previous networking
and security classes i'm currently going to add more from my current classes (including this one)
and some potential other's i want to add once i start to fully get into Html,Css and Python.</p>
<h3>Aspiring Project's</h3>
<p> Currently i am trying to get into python project's i am running algorithms with it currently and learning out how it functions
through that but i intend to use w3schools to get a basic understanding of it and then go from there, i also am interested in cybersecurity i am doing a competition at the moment
to become more familar with cybersecurity called NCL i am doing it with the networking and cybersecurity club.  After all that rambling here are some projects i am thinking about below:
<ul>
<li> Basic Python Project's simple input and output</li>
<li> Ai algorithms of some sort already did K-means but want to do some more</li>
<li>Security Project's scanning,learning how to analyze network traffic attacking MY OWN SERVER/SCHOOL PROVIDED NO ILLEGAL STUFF HERE</li>
</ul>
