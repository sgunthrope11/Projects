<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is <strong>Seven Gunthrope</strong> i am a student interested in technology.
I love technology which is why i really want to enter this field, when it comes to troubleshooting,
tinkering and learning new thing's it's something i really enjoy doing. I was originally a CS student
but as time went on  the theoreticals and mathematical part's slowly started to make me dislike it more and more. Then i decided to change my major to IT a prof
from my community college talked to me about and told me it was more about managing and fixing rather then focused
on coding and theories, so i decided to give it a try. Prior to this my first project even related to computers was me building my own desktop
gaming pc because the prebuilts where just not in the budget. I loved every second of it the whole first day i couldn't even 
put the IO shield in <i>(it still isn't in to this day)</i>. However the next day i looked up a video and read the manuals and finished 
in 4 hours, and it was up and running in a hour. After that i took my first set of classes and realized it's what i wanted coding was 
still there however instead of debugging for hours on logic, it was more about managing, reading network configurations, and also 
getting hands on with servers and messing around with different components. Through this i decided to choose network admin on top of IT 
which i ended enjoying even MORE along side the fixing and troubleshooting, This ended up with my prof really seeing that and he offered me 
a internship that is listed below but from there i ended up where i am currently getting my bachelors and still looking for any opportunities to get 
more experience i will say i am interested in cybersecurity and networking but honestly anything would be good since i really want to learn as many
aspect's i can. if i do end up getting another internship for troubleshooting,or helpdesk im interested in what exactly happens to printers<i>(i have
heard so many horror stories about them)</i>.
