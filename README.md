# Projects
Hello my name is Seven Gunthrope and these are my projects right now it only consist of a html/css project that is only html right now but i plan to add css by the end of this semester it also contains a security policy project which had me create policies for microsoft as if i was them, and a networking projecting that had me create a low cost networking solution that connected multiple work sites across cities from a central location. I am also learning AI algorithims currently with python so i will be starting up projects while learning python as well, that is all for right now but i will actively upload changes to these projects and updates that i make.
